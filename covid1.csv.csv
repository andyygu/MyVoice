1359,"I've kept up to date on COVID-19 through the legitimate sources we should be trusting, the CDC and WHO. As a resident of Washington state, ground zero for coronavirus in the United States, I think it is absolutely ridiculous how the media is appropriating ""pandemic panic."" Statistics about the death rate cannot be accurately gauged since many cases are currently undetected and individuals contracting the disease do not feel the need to seek medical care for a disease that gives the same symptoms as the common cold and the flu. The number of event cancellations is frankly angering. For those who are unwell, stay home - especially the elderly and those with underlying health concerns (since they are the only ones who are at risk). Honestly if everyone made as big of a deal about the flu, a virus that is much more prevalent than the coronavirus since it occurs annually and kills babies, those with underlying health concerns, and the elderly, maybe they would actually get their vaccines. ","The coronavirus has led to the cancellation of a once in a lifetime event for me at a journalism and awards conference by the CSPA in New York at Columbia University. As an editor for my yearbook staff, we would have had the chance to participate in a variety of workshops  led by America's best journalists. This experience can never be replicated and it was simply taken away because people are so panicked by the coronavirus. Additionally, I know that there are schools being shut down in my state. It is affecting my ability to learn in class since teachers are rushing to avoid what they see as inevitable school closures. I am convinced the coronavirus is already in my area and school and community since it shows the same symptoms as the cold and flu. There simply hasn't been a death for the media to pounce on and broadcast for their morbid death count. While it is understandable that we
 want to let COVID-19 reach carrying capacity by attempting to limit the spread of disease, the Cornoavirus is already here. Everyone should continue to wash their hands and avoid touching their faces. It is important to disinfect surfaces as it always is - including phone screens and door handles and keyboards. Those with underlying health concerns and the elderly who are immunocompromised should adhere to warnings and stay inside; however, that is not an excuse for everyone to put an indefinite hold on LIVING.","I'm not worried about coronavirus whatsoever. It's absolutely no worse than the flu. I'm not immunocompromised. Moreover, I have the common sense to wash my hands, resist touching my face, and stay home if I'm sick. The maelstrom of terror that is hitting the country is ridiculous and unwarranted. People need to get facts from trustworthy sources and get a grip. The paranoia is spiraling out of control. ","I will continue to wash my hands, avoid touching my face, and simply stay home if I am sick. If I catch the coronavirus, I will be fine within a few days - just like the common cold or flu. There is no need for mass panic. We already have clean water and food. Yet more than that, I am sensible. It's a disease - not Armageddon. ",I think the elderly and those with underlying health concerns should stay home. Travel has already been limited - not that it matters since the disease is already here.
