1984,"No, because I've heard that it's not very dangerous",White or Caucasian

2086,"No. There is very little to worry about it. It's not very widespread, not numerous (affecting so far less than 0.001% of the popular), 3-4 times less lethal than the flue, and so on. It's just been overly 'hyped' so to speak",White or Caucasian
2091,"Not really, odds of getting it are not high",White or Caucasian
2092,I was but then I realized there is no reason to be worried because eventually I will get it and then become immune to it. The death rate is small and basically the same as the flu death rate.

2112,I am not worried about it yet because it hasn't reached my area and the death rate doesn't affect my demographic ,White or Caucasian
2114,i am not because i am not immunodeficient ,White or Caucasian
2118,I am a little. It has the capability to infect a lot of people and it is very dangerous for older people and children. I am not so worried that I have done anything different day to day,White or Caucasian

2138,I am not concerned because from the statistics the only people who have an underlying health condition will die ,White or Caucasian
2139,"I'm not worried because my immune system is good, there are only a few cases near me and American doctors are some of the best in the world",White or Caucasian
2141,"Not really? I'm probably not going to get because I'm pretty clean, but even I do, it probably won't kill me",White or Caucasian
2142,i'm not worried just because there have been so many outbreaks like this such as zika and ebola and the situation has been very manageable ,White or Caucasian
2145,I am not worried about coronavirus because it doesn't affect most people different than the flu ,White or Caucasian
2147,eh? It's both a large issue and not really. I basically just live my normal life and wash my hands more,White or Caucasian
2148,"I'm not personally worried about coronavirus because death rates for my age group are so low, but I am worried for the virus's effects on the rest of the country, including the economy and daily life.  ",White or Caucasian

These things happen
It's always okay though",White or Caucasian
2194,"i have a strong immune system, so i'm not too worried about it",White or Caucasian
2196,I am not because I feel like it is similar to other scares we have had in the past and people are making it seem worse than it actually is,White or Caucasian
2200,"Not really. The area where I live is pretty far from any cases. We had a scare once, but it was just a really bad flu. Also, humans are quickly destroying the planet, so yeah ",White or Caucasian
